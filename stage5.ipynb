       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "120624  Whether you're boiling pasta, making a batch of chili or cooking grains, this large, 10 quart stockpot is just the right size. When it's not on the stovetop, its two short side handles help it take up less space in your cabinet.

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint.Light weight and durableEasy to installWill not warp or splinterAdds a decorative finish to any ceiling fixture                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long</td>\n",

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "72911   When making plans for design improvements to the home or office, one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to increase visual appeal and value is to add Crossheads to your doorways and windows. Whether you're working with indoor or outdoor applications, Crossheads are an excellent design improvement to the outer casings of doorways and windows. Often used in tandem with other architectural trim items like Pilasters, Crossheads provide outstanding visual improvement without spending a lot of money. Our Crossheads are made of a highly dense foam product called Urethane. Urethane has the same basic feel of Pine wood without having to deal with the typical weathering issues of a wood product. They are water proof and unappealing to insects and will not expand or contract with fluctuating temperatures so they will not crack your paint. This makes our Crossheads ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. Our Crossheads come in a variety of sizes and are easy for anyone to install. They can be trimmed with common woodworking tools and installed with simple construction adhesives and wood applicable hardware.Eye-catching style for your door or windowsLightweight and easy to installLow maintenance productAn answer for both indoor and outdoor applicationsOptional trim to add further depth and personalityAdd pilasters and pediments for an extraordinary look                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation.

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "109829  Nature comes inside in our Crystal Jewel Tiffany collection. 120 pieces of art glass, crystal jewels and genuine pebble stones in earthy shades of amber, cream, brown blue and off white are laid in an alternating pattern of pebbles and seashell, set in deep, rich filigree around the shade's diameter. A band of natural colored art glass runs just underneath the stones and shells, creating a lovely contrast. The uplit-inverted shade sits atop elongated scrolls, intertwined with metal and amber art glass leaves. The stepped base features a reeded pattern on the pedestal and is finished in lustrous antique golden sand.

       "      <td>The Original SUNHEAT 1500 Watt electric portable infrared heater with remote control and Made in USA cabinetry provides safe, soft, comfortable warmth for any area of your home. The SUNHEAT model SH-1500RC is a supplemental heating system designed to heat up to 1,000 sq. ft. with no harmful emissions. Three cured copper cylinders offer substantial storage capacity for the infrared heat produced by six 250 Watt commercial grade quartz heat tubes. These core elements, combined with a high velocity fan and a lifetime washable filter, produce a heat output of room temperature plus 120 degree Fahrenheit. This relatively low but highly efficient output allows the infrared heat to be absorbed by the moisture in the air as it's pulled into the heat chamber. The warm moist air then flows out of the heater and transfers soft infrared warmth to the people and objects in the room. The result is comfortable radiant heating, floor to ceiling and wall to wall. The beautiful all wood cabinet, available in five decorator colors, stays cool to the touch and completes any room. The remote control model has LED display and twin timers, allowing you to set a time for the unit turns on and off.

       "27413   This Bench is made from recycled plastic lumber (RPL), because it's a durable environmentally friendly alternative to traditional lumber. The material we use is made from an extremely high performance polymer that does not require sealing, painting or staining. It will not rot or splinter, and contains UV inhibitors that resist fading. It does not contain any filler, such as wood fiber, that would cause moisture absorption and promote bacterial growth. The recycled material utilized in our plastic lumber is a combination of consumer waste and industrial by-products which would normally be disposed of in our landfills.Warranty: 20 Year residential and 5 year commercial warranty warranty under normal useSome assembly requiredItem type is patio garden benchStyle:  traditional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "219501  The Original SUNHEAT 1500 Watt electric portable infrared heater with remote control and Made in USA cabinetry provides safe, soft, comfortable warmth for any area of your home. The SUNHEAT model SH-1500RC is a supplemental heating system designed to heat up to 1,000 sq. ft. with no harmful emissions. Three cured copper cylinders offer substantial storage capacity for the infrared heat produced by six 250 Watt commercial grade quartz heat tubes. These core elements, combined with a high velocity fan and a lifetime washable filter, produce a heat output of room temperature plus 120 degree Fahrenheit. This relatively low but highly efficient output allows the infrared heat to be absorbed by the moisture in the air as it's pulled into the heat chamber. The warm moist air then flows out of the heater and transfers soft infrared warmth to the people and objects in the room. The result is comfortable radiant heating, floor to ceiling and wall to wall. The beautiful all wood cabinet, available in five decorator colors, stays cool to the touch and completes any room. The remote control model has LED display and twin timers, allowing you to set a time for the unit turns on and off. This reliable infrared heater comes with a 3 years parts and labor warranty, cannot start a fire, is safe to operate anywhere, all the time, even around children and pets, but best of all it will slash your heating costs.Six 250 Watt quartz infrared heat tubes produces a safe, soft, comfortable heat output of room temperature plus 120 degree Fahrenheit (room temp 72 degree + 120 degree heat differential = 192 degree heat output)24 oz. of Cured copper provides a large heat sink and produces 7-10 minutes of free heat each heating cycleHeats up to 1,000 sq. ft. perfect to heat larger areas like basements, living rooms, bedrooms, any space in your home, allowing you to turn down the furnace and save moneyTwin timer allows you to set a time for the unit to turn on and off, but this infrared heater works best when allowed to cycle on and off as needed to maintain your comfort settingAn Electronic thermostat can be adjusted on the heater by the press of a button or by remote control, LED display shows room temperature and your heat settingPlugs into 110v home outlet, no installation required, uses stable, economical and efficient electric powerAverage seasonal savings $500, costs approximately $1.50 per day to run, estimated season cost of operation $280Last setting memory, the heater will restart to your comfort setting after power outage, generator compatibleCannot start a fire, automatic shut off, safety touch fabric covering heat register and an all wood Made in USA cabinet stays cool to the touch7 ft.

       "157209  The Monticello 24 ft. Work Station Kit is specifically designed for the Monticello line of greenhouses (24ft greenhouses). The design is simple, unique and thoughtful. The Work Station can be installed either during initial construction or at a later time. The Kit Includes a full 24 ft. run (24 in. deep) for use on either side of the Monticello greenhouse. The commercial grade and design of the Work Station allows for quick installation (about 60 minutes) and versatility. Since the installation of the support bars uses the inside bolt tracks the shelving could be set at any height within the greenhouse (up to 4ft off the ground). The sturdy vented shelving units on the Work Station are constructed from commercial grade high impact PVC. The vents allow water and air to circulate as well as allowing sunlight to reach underneath the Work Bench. The angle support design allows for free flowing movement without concern for support legs to trip over when working at the workbench. The bench itself will hold up to 1,500 lbs..Just like our greenhouses, the Monticello Work Station Kit is proudly made in The USA from start to finish.24 ft. W x 2 ft. Deep x 30 in.

       "158320  The economy line of inverter MIG welders from Everlast is not short on performance or capability. The all new Power i-MIG 140E is a 120-Volt powerhouse. The IGBT inverter design puts out a higher amp output with a better duty cycle when compared to transformer based MIG welders. Compare the Power i-MIG 140E to the competition. The competition features a transformer 140-amp MIG welder which typically has a 20% duty cycle at 90-amp, and a far less duty cycle at maximum amps which is almost never published. The new Everlast Power i-MIG 140E comes with a 35% duty cycle at maximum 140-amps of power. And it can do it while operating more efficiently, at a lower amp draw. To complete the comparison, it is also lighter in weight and offers a smaller foot print without reducing the maximum diameter wire roll size (8 in.). Its size and weight allows you to pick up the unit and carry it right to where you need it without needing a follow up visit to your chiropractor.Inverter based design lowers weight and power consumption while increasing duty cycle, and arc performanceSteeples control of both the wire speed and voltage, no tapped settingsBasic, familiar design allows easy transfer of operator skillsDurable IGBT components offer longer lifeStable, smooth arc with good wet in characteristics110/120-volt design allows the unit to be used almost anywhereSturdy drive mechanism is designed for years of useStandard drive rolls can feed 0.023 in. - 0.030 in. wire diameterDesigned to be used with both 4 in. and 8 in. wire spoolsHome Depot Protection Plan:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "207922  BugZip is specially designed for advanced resistance to bed bugs. Diligently encasing all clothing, bags and belongings while traveling greatly reduces the likelihood of bringing bed bugs home or from place to place. BugZip is also a great resource for individuals and families whose homes are already infested. BugZip encasements are recommended for use in one location only. Bugs can be on the outside of the BugZip and may be hard to see. Bringing a used BugZip from place to place defeats the purpose of the product.

       "83558   BEAPCO Drop-Ins Fruit Fly Traps give home owners 180 days of continuous fruit fly protection. The \"food grade\", non-toxic lure solution draws the fruit flies into the see-through traps where they are unable to escape. The patented, conical trap design also prevents the lure solution from spilling out from the traps, if it is dropped or knocked off the counter. Each trap lasts for 30 days with almost no monitoring or maintenance. Once the 30 days are up, simply dispose of the traps in your regular, household trash and replace with a new trap. Simple and effective. Each package comes with 6 fill-able traps and our patented non-toxic Lure Solution.Traps lasts up to 180 days of fruit fly trapping (30 days per trap)Innovative Drop-Ins trap system prevents fruit flies from escaping trap once they are caughtTraps are designed to prevent the lure solution from spilling out - even when tipped overClear trap design lets you know when fruit flies have been caughtPlace traps on or near countertops, fruit bowls, sinks, kitchen tablesTested and proven to catch 2X more fruit flies than leading brandsNon-toxic, food grade lure solution actively draws bed bugs into the clear trapsMade in CanadaSecondary testing has shown that BEAPCO's fruit fly traps capture 2.2X more than other household productsTo setup, simply fill each trap with the lure solution, up to the fill line and place on counter tops, near fruit or wherever you have problem areas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

The higher the concentration of co, the faster the alarm will sound. Above 200 ppm, the alarm will sound continuously. A backlight on the display can be used for low light areas. Additional features include: max hold, data hold and auto-power-off. The meter comes complete with a 9-volt battery, protective holster and case.Auto zero at startup1 ppm resolution with plus/minus 5% or plus/minus 10 ppm basic accuracy (whichever is greater)Utilizes a stabilized electrochemical gas specific (CO) fast response sensorMemory stores 10 readings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
