MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long</td>\n",

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation. A tough metal media retainer is adhered to the frame on both upstream and downstream sides for extra filter strength. For peak equipment protection and energy efficiency, these filters should be changed monthly in periods of high use.

       "114403  Checking co levels is as easy as pushing just 1 button on the model C010, which measures up to 1,000 ppm. An audible indicator increases in tone starting at 35 ppm. The higher the concentration of co, the faster the alarm will sound. Above 200 ppm, the alarm will sound continuously. A backlight on the display can be used for low light areas. Additional features include: max hold, data hold and auto-power-off.

       "83558   BEAPCO Drop-Ins Fruit Fly Traps give home owners 180 days of continuous fruit fly protection. The \"food grade\", non-toxic lure solution draws the fruit flies into the see-through traps where they are unable to escape. The patented, conical trap design also prevents the lure solution from spilling out from the traps, if it is dropped or knocked off the counter. Each trap lasts for 30 days with almost no monitoring or maintenance. Once the 30 days are up, simply dispose of the traps in your regular, household trash and replace with a new trap. Simple and effective.

MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long</td>\n",

Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint.Light weight and durableEasy to installWill not warp or splinterAdds a decorative finish to any ceiling fixture                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "83558   BEAPCO Drop-Ins Fruit Fly Traps give home owners 180 days of continuous fruit fly protection. The \"food grade\", non-toxic lure solution draws the fruit flies into the see-through traps where they are unable to escape. The patented, conical trap design also prevents the lure solution from spilling out from the traps, if it is dropped or knocked off the counter.

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation. A tough metal media retainer is adhered to the frame on both upstream and downstream sides for extra filter strength. For peak equipment protection and energy efficiency, these filters should be changed monthly in periods of high use.

MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold.

Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long</td>\n",

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint.Light weight and durableEasy to installWill not warp or splinterAdds a decorative finish to any ceiling fixture                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "198625  Grease fittings are metal fittings which attach to a bearing as part of a lubrication system. One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing. The valve closes when the pressure is relieved and the ball is not depressed to close out debris. This also ensures grease does not escape. They are offered in straight, 45 and 90 degree constructions to meet specific application needs.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information1-piece per bagSteel constructionPlain finish8 mm x 190 Degree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold.

Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long</td>\n",

The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions.

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation. A tough metal media retainer is adhered to the frame on both upstream and downstream sides for extra filter strength. For peak equipment protection and energy efficiency, these filters should be changed monthly in periods of high use.

       "      <td>The Tree Trainer is an innovative product award winner through the American Nursery and Landscape Association. Designed as an environmentally safe product that has been engineered for durability. Features include an aluminum body and accessories, zinc plated steel studs and a UV inhibitor impregnated into the straps to protect from sun deterioration. The Tree Trainer is easy to use, reusable and eliminates the unsightliness of stakes and wires around your tree.

       "65954   The Tree Trainer is an innovative product award winner through the American Nursery and Landscape Association. Designed as an environmentally safe product that has been engineered for durability. Features include an aluminum body and accessories, zinc plated steel studs and a UV inhibitor impregnated into the straps to protect from sun deterioration. The Tree Trainer is easy to use, reusable and eliminates the unsightliness of stakes and wires around your tree. By using oppositional pressure, it supports vertical alignment while straightening the tree. This technique allows the tree fibers (cambia) to grow, correcting themselves in the process. No stakes, no wires, no problems just straighter trees.Small Tree Trainer designed to fit tree diameters 1/2 in. to 1 1/2 in.Adjustable oxidized cast aluminum saddle, head and barrelExtendable zinc coated 3/8 in. steel boltsFlexible UV inhibitor impregnated polypropylene strapsPowder-coated steel cam buckles1/8 in. thick neoprene bark protecting saddle pad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
