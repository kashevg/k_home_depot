Whether you're working with indoor or outdoor applications, Crossheads are an excellent design improvement to the outer casings of doorways and windows. Often used in tandem with other architectural trim items like Pilasters, Crossheads provide outstanding visual improvement without spending a lot of money. Our Crossheads are made of a highly dense foam product called Urethane. Urethane has the same basic feel of Pine wood without having to deal with the typical weathering issues of a wood product. They are water proof and unappealing to insects and will not expand or contract with fluctuating temperatures so they will not crack your paint. This makes our Crossheads ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. Our Crossheads come in a variety of sizes and are easy for anyone to install. They can be trimmed with common woodworking tools and installed with simple construction adhesives and wood applicable hardware.Eye-catching style for your door or windowsLightweight and easy to installLow maintenance productAn answer for both indoor and outdoor applicationsOptional trim to add further depth and personalityAdd pilasters and pediments for an extraordinary look</td>\n",

       "72911   When making plans for design improvements to the home or office, one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to increase visual appeal and value is to add Crossheads to your doorways and windows. Whether you're working with indoor or outdoor applications, Crossheads are an excellent design improvement to the outer casings of doorways and windows. Often used in tandem with other architectural trim items like Pilasters, Crossheads provide outstanding visual improvement without spending a lot of money. Our Crossheads are made of a highly dense foam product called Urethane. Urethane has the same basic feel of Pine wood without having to deal with the typical weathering issues of a wood product. They are water proof and unappealing to insects and will not expand or contract with fluctuating temperatures so they will not crack your paint. This makes our Crossheads ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. Our Crossheads come in a variety of sizes and are easy for anyone to install. They can be trimmed with common woodworking tools and installed with simple construction adhesives and wood applicable hardware.Eye-catching style for your door or windowsLightweight and easy to installLow maintenance productAn answer for both indoor and outdoor applicationsOptional trim to add further depth and personalityAdd pilasters and pediments for an extraordinary look                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "198625  Grease fittings are metal fittings which attach to a bearing as part of a lubrication system. One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing. The valve closes when the pressure is relieved and the ball is not depressed to close out debris. This also ensures grease does not escape. They are offered in straight, 45 and 90 degree constructions to meet specific application needs.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information1-piece per bagSteel constructionPlain finish8 mm x 190 Degree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "120624  Whether you're boiling pasta, making a batch of chili or cooking grains, this large, 10 quart stockpot is just the right size. When it's not on the stovetop, its two short side handles help it take up less space in your cabinet.

Whether you're working with indoor or outdoor applications, Crossheads are an excellent design improvement to the outer casings of doorways and windows. Often used in tandem with other architectural trim items like Pilasters, Crossheads provide outstanding visual improvement without spending a lot of money. Our Crossheads are made of a highly dense foam product called Urethane. Urethane has the same basic feel of Pine wood without having to deal with the typical weathering issues of a wood product. They are water proof and unappealing to insects and will not expand or contract with fluctuating temperatures so they will not crack your paint. This makes our Crossheads ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. Our Crossheads come in a variety of sizes and are easy for anyone to install. They can be trimmed with common woodworking tools and installed with simple construction adhesives and wood applicable hardware.Eye-catching style for your door or windowsLightweight and easy to installLow maintenance productAn answer for both indoor and outdoor applicationsOptional trim to add further depth and personalityAdd pilasters and pediments for an extraordinary look</td>\n",

One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing.

       "72911   When making plans for design improvements to the home or office, one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to increase visual appeal and value is to add Crossheads to your doorways and windows. Whether you're working with indoor or outdoor applications, Crossheads are an excellent design improvement to the outer casings of doorways and windows. Often used in tandem with other architectural trim items like Pilasters, Crossheads provide outstanding visual improvement without spending a lot of money. Our Crossheads are made of a highly dense foam product called Urethane. Urethane has the same basic feel of Pine wood without having to deal with the typical weathering issues of a wood product. They are water proof and unappealing to insects and will not expand or contract with fluctuating temperatures so they will not crack your paint. This makes our Crossheads ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. Our Crossheads come in a variety of sizes and are easy for anyone to install. They can be trimmed with common woodworking tools and installed with simple construction adhesives and wood applicable hardware.Eye-catching style for your door or windowsLightweight and easy to installLow maintenance productAn answer for both indoor and outdoor applicationsOptional trim to add further depth and personalityAdd pilasters and pediments for an extraordinary look                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "198625  Grease fittings are metal fittings which attach to a bearing as part of a lubrication system. One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing. The valve closes when the pressure is relieved and the ball is not depressed to close out debris. This also ensures grease does not escape. They are offered in straight, 45 and 90 degree constructions to meet specific application needs.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information1-piece per bagSteel constructionPlain finish8 mm x 190 Degree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.
