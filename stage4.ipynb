The \"food grade\", non-toxic lure solution draws the fruit flies into the see-through traps where they are unable to escape.

Each trap lasts for 30 days with almost no monitoring or maintenance. Once the 30 days are up, simply dispose of the traps in your regular, household trash and replace with a new trap.

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation. A tough metal media retainer is adhered to the frame on both upstream and downstream sides for extra filter strength. For peak equipment protection and energy efficiency, these filters should be changed monthly in periods of high use.

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation. A tough metal media retainer is adhered to the frame on both upstream and downstream sides for extra filter strength. For peak equipment protection and energy efficiency, these filters should be changed monthly in periods of high use.

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "83558   BEAPCO Drop-Ins Fruit Fly Traps give home owners 180 days of continuous fruit fly protection. The \"food grade\", non-toxic lure solution draws the fruit flies into the see-through traps where they are unable to escape. The patented, conical trap design also prevents the lure solution from spilling out from the traps, if it is dropped or knocked off the counter. Each trap lasts for 30 days with almost no monitoring or maintenance. Once the 30 days are up, simply dispose of the traps in your regular, household trash and replace with a new trap. Simple and effective.

The higher the concentration of co, the faster the alarm will sound. Above 200 ppm, the alarm will sound continuously. A backlight on the display can be used for low light areas.
