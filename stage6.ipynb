       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with MemBrain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. MemBrain with MoistureSense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use MemBrain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. MemBrain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. MemBrain is not intended for exterior applications.Unlike traditional vapor retarders, MemBrain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dryFor use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is requiredPrevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winterAllows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summerInstalls like poly with an extra level of moisture protectionContinuous air barrier and smart vapor retarderUnique, patented productRoll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "65960   This is a standard grade furnace filter of the same type that has been protecting furnaces and central air conditioners around the world for over 50 years. The filtering medium is continuous filament spun glass. The frame is made with one continuous piece of chipboard to guard against corner separation. A tough metal media retainer is adhered to the frame on both upstream and downstream sides for extra filter strength. For peak equipment protection and energy efficiency, these filters should be changed monthly in periods of high use.

The Intelligent Alarm combines the detection capabilities of an ionization smoke sensor - which is more likely to detect smaller, less visible fire particles, like those produced by flaming fires - with that of an electro-chemical sensor, which is used to detect CO.Provides protection for smoke and carbon monoxide in one deviceVoice alarm announces the hazard type for quick notification warning, carbon monoxide or danger, fire, fireTest/reset button checks the unit's functionality and quiets false alarmsHush mode activated and hush mode cancelled voice announcementBattery safe guard, unit cannot be mounted without batteries installedLow-battery warning alerts you when the battery needs replacingAlarm had detected a CO level of 100 ppm or higher, the unit will announce carbon monoxide previously detected to warn of the CO incident, when the test/reset button is pressedAvailable in a 2 pack THD online 204830114Product not available for sale in the state of California                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "114403  Checking co levels is as easy as pushing just 1 button on the model C010, which measures up to 1,000 ppm. An audible indicator increases in tone starting at 35 ppm. The higher the concentration of co, the faster the alarm will sound. Above 200 ppm, the alarm will sound continuously. A backlight on the display can be used for low light areas.

To identify the model/UPC number on your ceiling fan, please look for a label on the top of your motor housing (usually a silver sticker), which will include the manufacturer's model number and/or UPC number (12 digits). TIP: If it is difficult to see the label without taking down your fan, consider using your smart phone to take a picture of the label. If you can't find the label and you need assistance, please take a couple of pictures of the entire fan before contacting customer care so we can help you properly identify your fan.Replacement blade arm set for 44 in.

Unlike traditional vapor retarders, Mem Brain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use Mem Brain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. Mem Brain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. Mem Brain is not intended for exterior applications Unlike traditional vapor retarders, Mem Brain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dry For use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is required Prevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winter Allows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summer Installs like poly with an extra level of moisture protection Continuous air barrier and smart vapor retarder Unique, patented product Roll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long</td>\n",

       "128765  Moisture in walls is unavoidable, but managing it is easy with Mem Brain Continuous Air Barrier and Smart Vapor Retarder. Mem Brain with Moisture Sense technology installs just like poly, but with an extra level of moisture protection, allowing wall cavities to dry out, helping prevent mold. Unlike traditional vapor retarders, Mem Brain not only blocks moisture in the winter (When humidity in the cavity is low), it also increases permeability during the summer (When humidity is high), letting moisture escape while still maintaining air tightness. Use Mem Brain with un-faced insulation in place of kraft faced insulation or polyethylene. Not all climate zones require vapor retarders. Mem Brain is for use as an interior air barrier and smart vapor retarder. Mem Brain is not intended for exterior applications Unlike traditional vapor retarders, Mem Brain helps prevent mold by sensing and adapting permeance to varying humidity throughout the year to keep the wall cavity dry For use with un-faced insulation as a vapor retarder in climate zones where one is required Prevents moisture vapor from entering the wall cavity in the winter Allows any moisture buildup to escape the wall cavity in the summer Installs like poly with an extra level of moisture protection Continuous air barrier and smart vapor retarder Unique, patented product Roll is 100 in. tall and 50 ft. long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

Designed as an environmentally safe product that has been engineered for durability. Features include an aluminum body and accessories, zinc plated steel studs and a UV inhibitor impregnated into the straps to protect from sun deterioration. The Tree Trainer is easy to use, reusable and eliminates the unsightliness of stakes and wires around your tree.

       "198625  Grease fittings are metal fittings which attach to a bearing as part of a lubrication system. One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing. The valve closes when the pressure is relieved and the ball is not depressed to close out debris. This also ensures grease does not escape.

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation.

       "198625  Grease fittings are metal fittings which attach to a bearing as part of a lubrication system. One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing. The valve closes when the pressure is relieved and the ball is not depressed to close out debris. This also ensures grease does not escape.

       "198625  Grease fittings are metal fittings which attach to a bearing as part of a lubrication system. One end is threaded for permanent attachment while the other end of the nipple is used as a connection for a grease gun to push lubricant through under high pressure. This pressure opens a ball valve inside the grease fitting and allows grease to flow into the bearing. The valve closes when the pressure is relieved and the ball is not depressed to close out debris. This also ensures grease does not escape.

       "174120  Our ceiling medallion collections are modeled after original historical patterns and designs. Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions are achieved only by using our high density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint Light weight and durable Easy to install Will not warp or splinter Adds a decorative finish to any ceiling fixture                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "72911   When making plans for design improvements to the home or office, one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to increase visual appeal and value is to add Crossheads to your doorways and windows. Whether you're working with indoor or outdoor applications, Crossheads are an excellent design improvement to the outer casings of doorways and windows. Often used in tandem with other architectural trim items like Pilasters, Crossheads provide outstanding visual improvement without spending a lot of money. Our Crossheads are made of a highly dense foam product called Urethane. Urethane has the same basic feel of Pine wood without having to deal with the typical weathering issues of a wood product. They are water proof and unappealing to insects and will not expand or contract with fluctuating temperatures so they will not crack your paint. This makes our Crossheads ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. Our Crossheads come in a variety of sizes and are easy for anyone to install. They can be trimmed with common woodworking tools and installed with simple construction adhesives and wood applicable hardware Eye-catching style for your door or windows Lightweight and easy to install Low maintenance product An answer for both indoor and outdoor applications Optional trim to add further depth and personality Add pilasters and pediments for an extraordinary look                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "120624  Whether you're boiling pasta, making a batch of chili or cooking grains, this large, 10 quart stockpot is just the right size. When it's not on the stovetop, its two short side handles help it take up less space in your cabinet.
